<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://example.com)


- Faculty: Computing Science
- Course: BSc – Client Side Web Development
- Year/Stage: 1
- Assignment Title: Web Development Project
- Pages Included: 5
- Additional Content: 9 web pages and 1 stylesheet
- Date Developed: 06/05/16

### Project Description

This website is a project focused on the Sony Company, a multi-national organization. The design and functionality were developed with an emphasis on responsiveness and user experience. The project features include:

- #### Sticky Navigation Bar:

The site incorporates a sticky navigation bar that remains fixed on the side of the page as the user scrolls when the browser width is above 786px. For viewports at or below 786px, the navigation bar adapts and does not remain fixed.
- #### Dynamic Sidebar:

Certain pages include a sidebar on the left-hand side that displays facts about Sony. This sidebar remains stationary during scrolling, ensuring that useful information is always available to the user.
- #### Content Styling:
  
The main body content has been styled for clarity and aesthetics. Text formatting (including bullet points and centred text) is adapted according to the needs of each page. The primary font used is "Times New Roman", Times, serif, with the default text colour set to white. Depending on the section, link colours and other font styles have been adjusted to fit the overall design.
- #### Header and Background:
  
The page title is clearly displayed beneath a header image, providing context as the user navigates the website. The background image, sourced from a free resource such as subtlepatterns.com, sets an appealing tone for the overall design while the content areas retain a white background for readability.
- #### Footer Elements:

The footer includes convenient social media links and a "back to the top" button. These elements facilitate easy navigation and encourage user interaction. Adjustments were made to margin settings on some pages to avoid any layout collisions with the sidebar.

### Research and Design Inspirations

Research for the content on Sony was conducted using reputable sources such as Wikipedia, Sony’s official materials, and various informative articles. Videos featured on the media page were sourced from YouTube.
For the website design, inspiration was drawn from several sources:
- The idea for the sidebar navigation was inspired by websites such as goltzgroup.com and ls5.de.
- Code examples and techniques for creating a sticky navigation bar were researched on W3Schools and similar web development sites.
- Additional guidance came from academic lecture notes and online tutorials that assisted in customizing HTML, CSS, and JavaScript elements.
